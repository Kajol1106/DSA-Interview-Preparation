SELECT Airport.Name AS airport_name,
       SUM(ArrivalFlights) - SUM(DepartureFlights) AS flight_count_difference
FROM Airport
JOIN (
    SELECT Arrival_airport_id, COUNT(*) AS ArrivalFlights
    FROM Flights
    GROUP BY Arrival_airport_id
) AS Arrival ON Airport.Airport_id = Arrival.Arrival_airport_id
JOIN (
    SELECT Departure_airport_id, COUNT(*) AS DepartureFlights
    FROM Flights
    GROUP BY Departure_airport_id

GROUP BY Airport.Name
HAVING SUM(ArrivalFlights) > SUM(DepartureFlights)
ORDER BY flight_count_difference DESC, airport_name ASC;
